  - Full-stack web development through The Odin Project
  - Design and Analysis of Algorithms at UCI

## Current Projects:
### The Method:
- Developing with a team to create a production-ready website that allows users to create/revise resumes, prepare for behavioral interviews, and apply to jobs, all in one place.
  - Currently we are using React, PostgreSQL w/ SQLAlchemy, Docker, and Python w/ FastAPI.
  - We want to ensure we follow best practices, so we are using GitHub actions for CI/CD. We are also writing test cases and ensuring code stays readable.
### HarmoniXfer:
- Solo developing a full-stack web application that allows users to sync their playlists across YouTube and Spotify. Additionally, using Scikit-learn to perform machine learning to give song recommendations based on users' playlists.
